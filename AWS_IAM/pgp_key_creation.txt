sudo apt-get install gnupg
gpg --full-generate-key
Now after this provide user_name description and email_id
gpg --list-keys   :- to list the pgp key created for the users
gpg --export 31D613916E99749214FB3D2506059CED0841A43A | base64 > publicbase64.key  :-to create pgp public key
gpg --export-secret-key -a 31D613916E99749214FB3D2506059CED0841A43A > private.key   :- to create pgp private key


before this if getting erro do follwing steps:

To solve the problem, Please enable loopback pinentry mode.  Add below lines to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf:
use-agent 
pinentry-mode loopback

And add this to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf, creating the file if it doesn't already exist:
allow-loopback-pinentry

Now once secret is created decrypt its with help of below command
cat secret_key.txt | base64 --decode | gpg --decrypt                       :- first save output in secret_key.txt then decrypt it. use password provide to decrypt it.
